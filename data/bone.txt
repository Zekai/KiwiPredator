Bones are parts of the human or animal skeleton of vertebrates. They are stiff organs which make up the endoskeleton. Our body is made of flesh and blood built on a framework of bones. Without our bones, we could not stand up or move about. They also protect organs inside our body.[1] The skull protects the brain and the ribs protect the heart and lungs. The teeth support the facial muscles and help us smile. The number of bones in a human's neck is the same as a giraffe's.

Pineapple is a plant and a fruit. It is from Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It is also grown as a crop in other tropical areas, most famously in Hawaii. The plant is a short (1Ð1.5 m) with 30 or more trough-shaped, pointed leaves surrounding a thick stem. The fruit is slightly acidic and very tasty; some people like it on pizza or on ice cream.

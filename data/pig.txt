Pigs are mammals. Baby pigs are called piglets. Pigs can be eaten for food as pork, ham, and bacon. The Jewish and Muslim religions, and some Christian denominations, teach that eating pork is wrong.
They are often pink, but small pigs kept as pets (pot-bellied pigs) are often other colors. Pigs often roll in mud to protect themselves from sunlight. Many people think that pigs are dirty and smell. In fact, they roll around in the mud to keep parasitic animals (such as little bugs and ticks) away from their skin. This also helps to keep their skin moist and lower their body temperature on hot days. They are omnivores, which means they eat anything that comes in their way. Because their eyes are on the sides of their heads, pigs cannot look up to the sky.[1]
Pigs are very intelligent animals. They can be taught to dance, hunt for truffles, race, pull carts and sniff out landmines.[2] They can even be taught to play video games.[2]

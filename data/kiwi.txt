The Kiwi is a bird from New Zealand. They are the genus Apteryx of the family Apterygidae. There are several species and sub-species of kiwi. The kiwi is a symbol for New Zealand. People from New Zealand are nicknamed "Kiwis".

They have a long beak and brown feathers. The feathers look like fur. Kiwis cannot fly, and their wings are so small that they cannot usually be seen. Kiwis cannot see very well, but they can hear very well.

Kiwis are night (nocturnal) birds. They mostly eat invertebrates, like worms and insects. Kiwis keep a territory where they live alone or with their mate. In their territory they build several small caves where they sleep, or lay their eggs. Kiwis are monogamous; the male and female stay together until one of them dies. The male and female live in the same territory and raise their children together. Female kiwis lay 1-3 eggs. Compared to the size of the parent, the eggs are the largest of any bird species. Kiwis are mature when they are 2 years old, and they can live more than 20 years. One kiwi kept in a zoo even reached 35 years old.
